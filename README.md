# fibonacci_sequence
**About the project:**

This is a quick C++ demo, with two seperate implementations that can calculate a given value. One implementation utilises recursion, the other utilises a loop.

All of the original source code is located within src, these files were all compiled together to create "fibonacci_sequence.exe"

**Running the program:**

To execute the program on a windows machine; Double click "fibonacci_sequence.exe" | Within a terminal you might run .\fibonacci_sequence.exe

**Usage / Instructions:**

•	Upon execution, an input will be taken to determine what number in the fibonacci sequence you wish to determine. 

•	After a short delay two values should be displayed and timed, one listed as "Recursion", the other as "Loop".

**Proposed improvements / revisions:**

...

**Note:**

If you have any advice on how I might have approached this differently or improved the design please feel free to reach out, I welcome constructive criticism.
